My COMP9001 Final Project———
An interactive, command-line parrot-nurturing game.

Game Features:

Pet Status Management
Real-time tracking of four core metrics: Hunger, Happiness, Energy, and Health.

Feeding System
Use Feed (bird seed) to reduce Hunger and boost Happiness.

Interaction System
Pet your parrot’s head, wings, belly, or paws—each spot produces unique reactions and stat changes.

Travel System
Take your parrot on trips to four locations— Beach, Forest, Mountain, and City—triggering random scenes and recording each memory.

Random Event Engine**
Powered by an external JSON config (e.g. snail chase, electric shock, bubble popping).  Add, remove, or tweak events on the fly for endless surprises.

Mini-Games
Play Reaction Speed, Sequence Memory, Math Quiz, or Word Scramble to earn coins for feed.

Veterinary Care
Spend coins to heal your parrot—instantly restores Health and Energy to 100.

Real-Time Updates & Failure Mechanism
Get warnings when stats cross danger thresholds; continued neglect leads to “taken by animal protection” or “pet death,” with a clear failure message.
